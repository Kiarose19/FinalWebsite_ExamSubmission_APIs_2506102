          Goal Alignment for my website: My goal for this website is to
          efficiently convey the theme of space and Nasa throughout my website.
          The reason being I am using a Nasa open API for the data visualisation
          section of my website. Therefore, the website encapsulates and conveys
          space as a theme. For example, the use of starry backgrounds
          solidifies this idea of space, the fun facts, quotes, and jokes
          related to space and Nasa inform the user that this website is about
          space and Nasa which in turn also communicates why the data
          visualisation section makes use of a Nasa API. The target
          audience/users for this website would most likely be people who are
          passionate about space and want to know more about the data that Nasa
          collects.

          Notes on my visual aesthetic: The main visual aesthetic I was trying
          to achieve for my website as mentioned in the goal alignment section
          is the one of space. This was mainly done through the background image
          of each page. The background image is of stars with beautiful colours
          of orange-yellows, deep blues, and almost greyish white. I chose a
          busy background because the design throughout the rest of my website
          is quite simplistic and clean, therefore preventing any clashing/noise
          that will overwhelm the user by drawing their attention in multiple
          directions. I specifically chose colours for the textual elements of
          my website that would enhance the colours of the background while
          further conveying the theme of space. The colour choices are further
          discussed in the visual design elements section.

          Notes on my visual design elements: Fonts – I have decided to use one
          font throughout my website to create a cohesive and unified look. I
          did research on fonts that are most popular and best suited for
          websites finding a variety of interesting fonts. There were three
          fonts that I really thought would be suitable for my website. All
          three fonts had good readability which is something important for
          websites. However, I decided to choose the Source Sans Pro font. This
          is because this font was specifically designed for web design making
          the legibility and readability of high quality. The font was best
          suited for my website because of the busy background and variation of
          colours used in my website. Readability and legibility – The font
          impacts how the user understands the text as well as how convenient
          the designer makes it for the user to read. My website consists of
          good readability because the font is clear and concise. My website
          also makes use of evenly spaced text thereby not overwhelming the user
          with too much text to read and strain themselves in doing so. Colours
          – the colour palette that I have decided to use for my website is one
          that consists of black, blue, yellow, grey, and white. After doing
          research into modern colour palettes that are popularly used in the
          website domain, I decided to go with this colour palette. It consists
          of all the colours that emphasize space alongside working beautifully
          with the colours from the backgrounds in my website. It helps my
          website achieve a simple, clean look that feels very modern and
          inviting. These specific colours are not too harsh on the eye and when
          used correctly can tie the aesthetic of the website together. The
          reason these colours work so well together is because most of them are
          complementary and while the blue and yellow may give the website a pop
          of colour, the white and grey contrast harmoniously to dim down the
          busyness that could be created if those colours were used on their
          own. Hierarchy, Harmony, Balance – Throughout my website I have
          included the elements that I want the user to see at the top of each
          page. The use of heading tags has also been helpful in indicating what
          holds more importance on each page. I have included balance throughout
          my website by making layouts that ensure the elements of the page are
          evenly spaced and have similar positions if they have related content.
          for example, on the blog page the blog posts are the same length and
          style placed in the same position which indicates a relationship
          between them but also keeps the page balanced. Shape, Colour, Position
          - I have implemented rounded rectangles/squares in my website. The
          rounded effect portrays a friendliness to my website that is not
          commanding or domineering. It creates ease within the website. The
          position of elements is placed in a very neat and cohesive way as to
          not cause confusion in the user of what they mean/represent.
